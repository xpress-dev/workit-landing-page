# Post-development Notes

1. It was fun creating this layout. Really helped me brush up on my css skills and also refreshed the usage of background-position and the fact that it can be highly customizable.

2. This project was a complete demonstration of how well-presented a website looks like if it is fully responsive for various viewports.

3. Also the importance of creating a roadmap, recognizing the components, the elements used and things as such was re-iterated.
